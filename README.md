# Rubik Table MRPP Algorithm

## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of the Rubik Table algorithm for Multi-Robot Path Planning (MRPP). The algorithm is based on the research paper ["Expected 1.x Makespan-Optimal Multi-Agent Path Finding on
Grid Graphs in Low Polynomial Time"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05385).

## Overview
The Rubik Table MRPP algorithm provides a constant time-optimal solution for coordinating multiple robots on grids.

## Features
- Constant factor time-optimal multi-robot path planning with collision avoidance on grids
- Problem generator that generates problem instances
- Python visualizer
