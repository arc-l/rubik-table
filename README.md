# Rubik Table MRPP Algorithm

## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of the Rubik Table algorithm for Multi-Robot Path Planning (MRPP). The algorithm is based on the research paper ["Rubik Tables: A Table-Driven Approach to Multi-Robot Path Planning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05385).

## Overview
The Rubik Table MRPP algorithm provides an efficient solution for coordinating multiple robots in a shared workspace while avoiding collisions and minimizing travel time. This approach utilizes a table-driven methodology inspired by the mechanics of Rubik's Cube to generate and optimize paths for multiple robots simultaneously.

## Features
- Constant factor time-optimal multi-robot path planning with collision avoidance on grids
